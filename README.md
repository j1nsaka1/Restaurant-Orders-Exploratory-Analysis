# Restaurant-Orders-Exploratory-Analysis
I just learned SQL, I wanted to try a project which tests my basic command on the language, this restaurant orders table was the perfect fit for me.

the tables I used were menu_items.csv and order_details.csv
you can access the query.sql file in the repository which holds all the queries
